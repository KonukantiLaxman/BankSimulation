# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP Project)

This project simulates basic **bank operations** using **Java** and demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, inheritance, and method overriding**.  
It mimics real-world scenarios like deposits, withdrawals, interest addition, and transaction history.

## 📂 Project Structure
Bank Account Simulation/
├── BankAccount.java # Parent class (base account features)
├── SavingsAccount.java # Child class (extends BankAccount, adds interest)
├── BankSimulation.java # Main program (runs the simulation)
└── README.md # Documentation

 
 ## Features:

1.Create a bank account with an initial balance

2.Deposit money into the account

3.Withdraw money (with insufficient balance handling)

4.View current balance

5.Transaction history for all operations

6.Savings account with interest feature

7.Demonstrates Inheritance and Method Overriding

## 📖 Learning Outcomes:

1.Understand how OOP principles apply in real-world banking systems.

2.Learn to structure Java projects with multiple classes.

3.Practice inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in action.
