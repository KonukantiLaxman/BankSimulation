# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP Project)

This project simulates basic **bank operations** using **Java** and demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, inheritance, and method overriding**.  
It mimics real-world scenarios like deposits, withdrawals, interest addition, and transaction history.

├── BankAccount.java # Parent class (base account features)
├── SavingsAccount.java # Child class (extends BankAccount, adds interest)
├── BankSimulation.java # Main program (runs the simulation)
└── README.md # Documentation

 
 ## Features:

✅ Create a bank account with an initial balance

✅ Deposit money into the account

✅ Withdraw money (with insufficient balance handling)

✅ View current balance

✅ Transaction history for all operations

✅ Savings account with interest feature

✅ Demonstrates Inheritance and Method Overriding
